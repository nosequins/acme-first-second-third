Great job, Princess! This works perfectly and I like that your code is very readable and simple!
I made a couple comments in the script.js file but they were really minor! Some of them were around code hygiene.
One thing you might want to consider is using a formatter like prettier or anything else you prefer, so that it breaks your code up and makes it more readable.
